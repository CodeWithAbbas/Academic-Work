# High Throughput Communication Interface for HFT using FPGA
## Final Year Project (FYP)

Dive into my academic journey with this repository, highlighting my final year project, "High Throughput Communication Interface for HFT using FPGA." The project involves the implementation of MACD, RSI, and Aroon momentum technical indicators on a Zynq-SoC FPGA platform. Utilizing HDL design and optimization techniques, the project aims for high throughput and low latency in trading algorithms.
